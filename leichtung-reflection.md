# Josh's Reflections on GPS 1.1
* Prior to the session, the differences between doing a fetch and merge vs a
  pull were a little confusing. I am still a little fuzzy on when to merge vs
  rebase. Since I have never had to work on a project with a lot of merges, I'm
  not as comfortable using HEAD^n as I am with HEAD~n. I also need more practice
  with revert and reset, and when to use them. 
* Our guide, Regina, helped us with fetch vs pull. She also gave us pointers on
  commit messages that were very helpful.
* I asked our guide about commit messages, and whether to specify the files
  edited in the message or just let it be shown through file changes. I also
  asked her for suggestions on extra learning resources. Jeremy was well prepared
  and we didn't really have any trouble completing the challenges, so most of my
  questions were related to how he was doing, if I was proceeding correctly when
  driving, what his background was, etc...
* I need more practice still with rebases, checkout out commits with ~ and ^,
  and using revert and reset. While I feel I understand these somewhat, I am not
  as confident about how they work as I would like to be, and I think that will
  just come with practice.
* Pairing with GPS was a good one. Jeremy was very advanced and on top of all
  the topics, which made things very smooth. Regina let us work, and chimed in
  with helpful information to help us understand best practices much better. She
  also suggested a few extra merge conflict resolution ideas we could work on
  since we moved through the exercises quickly. I really appreciated that extra
  thoughtfulness.
