#Jeremy's Reflections on GPS 1.1
* The primary thing with Git I was struggling with prior to the GPS session was getting used to Git via terminal again, as I had used TortoiseSVN at my last workplace, and a GUI for Git for my personal projects.
* One concept that was clarified was the difference between git fetch, git merge and git pull.
* I asked a few questions about git commit messages, as well as getting a brief refresher on vim when I ammended a commit
* I don't think there's anything about Git that confuses me, but I'm sure there will be when I start using it a lot more.
* My first experience of pairing in a GPS was pretty smooth overall. It helped that Josh was more familiar than I was in terminal.
